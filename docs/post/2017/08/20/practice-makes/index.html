<p>The brightest people I know practice or learn. Engineering things on the Internet is strange; it&rsquo;s a new frontier. In order to feel aware of the web&rsquo;s current state, through surprise blockchain forking, political revolts on social media, ominous machine intelligence, new web frameworks and morphing server architecture, there are countless unrelenting streams of which to be mindful. It is folly to hope to understanding even a fraction of our beloved and capable global network. In the tangle of all these topics to practice, what kind of patterns are we imprinting?</p>

<p>This weekend, you&rsquo;ve learned the basics of Ruby; next weekend, as per usual, you&rsquo;re interested in learning something new. You know the basics of Ruby, but how about&hellip; <em>LanguageX</em>. Another weekend, another basic set of syntax. Or, perhaps a new book about design patterns. Maybe you have written a new application, or library, or chipped away at a side-project; you are inspired by the potential and feel as though you&rsquo;re staying on top.</p>

<p>At this juncture, let&rsquo;s take a step back and evaluate the premises we&rsquo;ve established:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web engineering/development is an industry that moves with ferocity, speed, and depth; it&rsquo;s akin to a global tsunami of complex growth.</li>
<li>We accumulate knowledge of advanced topics and skills to stay afloat.</li>
<li>We habituate the collection novel knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two avenues I&rsquo;d love to explore. The first is what is driving our constant desire for knowledge. Like many in technical circles, I pay attention to Hacker News. Items that wind up on the front-page generate tens of thousands of impressions; they&rsquo;re exposed to the digital <em>intelligentsia</em>. The best ricochet through social networks, are co-opted and syndicated, and rise atop search engine rankings.</p>

<p>Hacker News has survived purge after purge of activities that feel like they cause me more distraction than benefit. The frothing, victor-less political and moral battlegrounds of social networks: gone. Aggregators with dubious ranking algorithms and suspect turf composition: gone. Once focused and objective tech media outlets: gone.</p>

<p>Hacker News remains because it&rsquo;s an insulated bubble of technology&rsquo;s <em>new and fascinating</em>; it self-governs well and stays focused. It&rsquo;s raw and organic, with the occasional submarine. It plays host to many perspectives and engaging debates, albeit with an often-overwhelming accuracy, brooding cynicism, and negativity. To understand why every weekend we feel something must be gained, we should understand the persuasive impact of thousands upon thousands of our peers.</p>

<p>Never before have flavours of the month been so apparent; in every compelling thread, an expert on every niche subject. This does not inspire comfort. It is easy to get the sensation that someone or something is always ahead, always better. We feel that if we <em>don&rsquo;t</em> study that we will fall behind the unseen, unrelenting curve. Our cushy jobs will vanish, the robots will take over and the rare chosen few, those who learned <em>that little bit extra</em> will be their handlers.</p>

<p>We tell ourselves that <em>we&rsquo;re interested</em>; this is my hobby and I <em>love</em> spending my weekends programming and reading books that will improve my performance and productivity. We are smart, and to the smart, it&rsquo;s implied: learning is effortless. One thing we&rsquo;ve learned, a meme that courses through the currents, is that the <em>best</em> work is done by those who <em>love what they do</em>.</p>

<p>So, of course we all love what we do; we&rsquo;re all going to stick around and find that money or that success or whatever it is we&rsquo;re seeking. It&rsquo;s going to be easy because we&rsquo;ve mastered the recipe: we&rsquo;re smart and we love it.</p>

<p>Not without cunning, fear and insecurity begin to drive us. We are driven by the fear of irrelevancy and the implication that the current thing we&rsquo;re doing, that once important and popular thing, is splashing towards meaninglessness. An even bigger wave is right behind it, rolling with ease over what once felt so monumental.</p>

<p>If we consider that fear is in the driver seat, the second avenue deals with what sort of patterns we <em>are</em> forming when our reading lists balloon with the data we feel we require to remain competitive in the market. We are learning to respond to fear and to place a higher value on the externalized realities whose potential persuades us more than that of our current reality.</p>

<p>When we get lost in the limitless nature of <em>new</em> potential, we lose track of the present. The present, once shimmering with possibility, has brought to light the challenges and struggles required to realize that potential. And so, we begin to <strong>defer</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Deference</strong> is a dark pattern. A casual example might look as follows: It&rsquo;s Wednesday afternoon and you are already wiped out; it&rsquo;s been a long week and you&rsquo;re stressed out. While eating dinner on Wednesday, you tell yourself that: &ldquo;On Friday, I will relax&rdquo;. Wednesday comes and goes and you&rsquo;ve remained in a state of distress. Thursday, the same: tomorrow is Friday, when that day comes, you&rsquo;ll relax.</p>

<p>Friday, sweet Friday arrives on its intoxicating golden cloud&hellip; You finish your meal and it&rsquo;s time to relax. But do you? Can you? When have you practiced, what&rsquo;s required to relax? Has relaxation become the consumption of substances that simulate contentedness? Your being cares little what day it is on the calendar; to it, it&rsquo;s like every other day. If you wanted to relax on Friday, or any day, you should have relaxed on Wednesday when you were in the midst of stress.</p>

<p>The only time that one is capable of relaxing is <em>right now</em>. You are unable to <em>defer</em> relaxation. If on Wednesday you can relax, then on Thursday you can relax, and Friday, and on and on &ndash; you&rsquo;re a relaxed person, you have taken the time to habituate relaxing patterns. Patterns do not come when called, they are woven and created over-time.</p>

<p>When learning chases us out into the future, we are deferring the development of patience. Instead of getting deeper into, and learning to enjoy, our present state, the <em>now</em> where we take place, we look for the new to bestow a more immediate reward. Without curiosity and a hunger for the knowledge we need to actualize wisdom, it&rsquo;s unlikely any of us would create beautiful and wonderful things. However, it takes great care not to lose oneself in the insatiable nature of the human condition.</p>

<p>Polishing ourselves and our abilities is useful, but to what end? Perfection is an unattainable goal. We are never able to <em>make perfect</em>, the best we can do is make <em>ourselves</em> content with our own progress. What is it that you&rsquo;re practicing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We humans are unhappy in large part because we are insatiable; after working hard to get what we want, we routinely lose interest in the object of our desire. Rather than feeling satisfied, we feel a bit bored, and in response to this boredom, we go on to form new, even grander desires.”</p>
