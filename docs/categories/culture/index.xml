      <description>Hockey is a beautiful sport. Like many younglings who were born in Western Canada, I was raised in part by hockey rinks. Not long after becoming sufficient in tippy baby-walking, I was outside in the deep cold of an Albertan winter with blades strapped to my feet. Little did I know that the sport of hockey would teach me some of the most valuable life lessons and become an integral aspect of my character and contribute to my successes in technical teams.</description>

      <description>My ears can hear whatever they want. There’s a magical program within my computer and when I explore it every composition becomes mine. It makes lists for me, using heuristics to determine what I’d like to listen to. It’s often right. Music is beautiful. Music is on rails. A part of music is dead.
Every song is sucked into an algorithm. It’s spliced into a thousand pieces, its beating heart counted to assess time signature.</description>

      <description>Growing up, my parents painted an intriguing picture of life after sprouting into adulthood. “I was out of the house at 18!”, my father would remind me. Having now grown well past the age that my parents were when they flew from their nests… then owned their first home… then had children… I feel that living in a one-bedroom apartment with questionable asset accumulating potential and no seedlings makes me look soft by comparison.</description>
