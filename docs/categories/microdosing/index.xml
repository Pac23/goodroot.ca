      <description>0: Prologue 1: Baseline
It takes a certain oddness to ingest a psychedelic mushroom every third evening. Looking at the studies and reading the anecdotes of others who have embraced the weirdness, microdosing appears an alluring offer. When you apply outside perception of the experiences, things get dicey. I&amp;rsquo;d like to speak more on that, then get into the work done to establish a baseline before under-taking this experiment; after-all, if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do something people think is silly or even dangerous, you might as well document your experiences and explain yourself.</description>

      <description>Today, I embark on a partnership. For the foreseeable future, I will be taking 0.2 grams of Psilocybe semilanceata mushrooms every third evening. I&amp;rsquo;d like to share why I&amp;rsquo;ve begun this adventure, what I hope to achieve, and document my experiences living a modern life, working in a fast-paced tech start-up. My intention is to write an update once per week, observing and describing the short and long-term impact of a softening, Psilocybin-infused consciousness.</description>
