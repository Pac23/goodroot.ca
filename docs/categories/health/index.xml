      <description>The brightest people I know practice or learn. Engineering things on the Internet is strange; it&amp;rsquo;s a new frontier. In order to feel aware of the web&amp;rsquo;s current state, through surprise blockchain forking, political revolts on social media, studious machine intelligence, new web frameworks and morphing server architecture, there are countless unrelenting streams of which to be mindful. It is folly to dream of understanding even a fraction of our beloved and capable global network.</description>

      <description>Many years ago, I had my life transformed by a silly book about cleaning. It was called: The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up and it was written by tidying Marie Kond≈ç. Marie suggests taking a step back from your busy life, breathing deeply, then decluttering your life in one ruthless material purge.
To become happier, more productive, and less stressed, she teaches one how to craft a simplified existence surrounded only by the things that spark joy within.</description>

      <description>For as long as I can remember, I have told people that I am allergic to penicillin. Whomever discovered my allergy discovered it on the first day of my life. I was given this broad-spectrum anti-biotic, despite being healthy, at birth.
Penicillin is a common anti-biotic, created from penicillium mold. If you find yourself afflicted with any sort of bacterial infection, your doctor may prescribe you this medicine.
I was one healthy and hilarious little creature.</description>
