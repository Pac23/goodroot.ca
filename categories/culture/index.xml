      <description>My ears can hear whatever they want. There&amp;rsquo;s a magical program within my computer and when I explore it every composition becomes mine. It makes lists for me, using heuristics to determine what I&amp;rsquo;d like to listen to. It&amp;rsquo;s often right. Music is beautiful. Music is on rails. A part of music is dead.
