## Kellen

### Grooving on the Internet circa 1998

Born Canadian, **Kellen** - also known as goodroot - is a wily and lighthearted veteran of the World Wide Web. He's spent nearly two decades developing things on the Internet.

His greatest joys are his friends and loved ones, meditation, reading and writing, building and scaling distributed web architecture, cooking, and helping sprout positive teams and communities.
