Today I am saddened to hear about the passing of Dr. Paul Roberts. Paul had a significant impact on my life. As 2017 opened up, I found myself at a cross-roads. All this technical skill, all these offers to further technology for technologies sake. Where's the spirit? What's the point?

A door opened up to me after a brilliant blog post compelled me to reach out to its author. My plea for guidance led me to the [Alianza Arkana](http://alianzaarkana.org), a non-profit working with the indigenous Shipibo people and the plant medicines of the Amazon.  That author was Paul, the director of Alianza Arkana.

I never wound up working with the Alianza Arkana. I did wind up speaking at length with Paul about things of all sorts, exchanging technical wisdom for Western-psyche shattering insights. I didn't know it then, but I understand it now; that mentorship I was seeking had been with me all along.

If you're interested in getting to know a dearly departed mind that illuminated new frontiers of consciousness exploration, [Paul's blog](https://conversationswithdonmachingaandotherbeings.wordpress.com
) is one of the best. Before passing he wrote a three-part, 10,000 word paper that I believe is important. 

**Earth-Beings, Plant Spirits, Ayahuasca and Equivocations** by Dr. Paul Roberts: 

* [Part One](https://conversationswithdonmachingaandotherbeings.wordpress.com/2017/04/23/earth-beings-plant-spirits-ayahuasca-and-equivocations-part-one/)
* [Part Two](https://conversationswithdonmachingaandotherbeings.wordpress.com/2017/05/07/part-two-earth-beings-plant-spirits-ayahuasca-and-equivocations/)
* [Part Three](https://conversationswithdonmachingaandotherbeings.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/part-three-earth-beings-plant-spirits-ayahuasca-and-equivocations/)

Thank you, Paul. Rest well, my friend. I will no longer hide from the insights we've both shared and the realities I know to be more real than real. May you find yourself in good company among the Other Beings.
