I am a child of the Internet. The allure of its borderless edges, never-ending stories, unrelenting novelty, and limitless supply of companions, had seduced me before I developed the faculties for resistance. The Internet is heralded as the greatest collaborative engineering effort in human history.  But it is much more than that. It is the mirror into which we meet our raw, carnal reality. It is the weaponized platform for our conflicts and outrage. It is the vehicle for our spiritual ascendence.

The world around me was polishing itself. There was a plan. By going to school, being quiet, and confining my perspectives into a curriculum, I was taught that I could succeed within it. This is science, this is history, this is how you write, this is how you behave. The machinery told me one thing. The Internet told me another. 

The Internet of today is tidy. Monolithic structures have risen as beacons of order. Your friends live in these Social Networks, your games are through these windows, these are the videos we recommend for you, all of your content is tidied and aggregated based on your interests, right here, for you. We travel through the vast networked seas together aboard great vessels. The great light houses guide us through the channels that, according to them, are safe. That plan, again.

Before, there were no beacons. You were alone in a dark and wild forest. You would see flickers of light in the distance. Unsure, you would crawl closer to see but a small flame illuminating hacked, derelict structures. What was in them, one could never be sure. As often as you would find light, so too would you find darkness. If you were searching for games, you would find out how to cheat. If you were looking for friends, you would find combatants. If you were looking for horror, sexuality, gore, and depravity, you would find it. If you were not looking for horror, sexuality, gore, and depravity, you would find it.  

In mere months, more emotions, more feelings, and more experiences than can fit within a lifetime.  What happens to the soul of a child, being exposed to the blackest shades of human truth? How can they reconcile what they have seen into the _”real”_ world? They cannot. They split in twain. A piece of them goes to school and has conversations at the dinner table. A piece of them hardens and continues to explore. An innocent young thing, clad in fleece jammies, eating a bowl of cereal. An explorer of the most dire, black, and wretched truths known to a species.

The forests were cleared. The shady rest stops were vacated for more padded and comfortable accommodations. You could find the same black things, with intention. But the package, the presentation, became cleaner, indexed. After chasing away the nameless ghosts, people were invited. Pseudonyms and anonymity gave way to curated self-representation. This is our present. The Internet, ever the mirror, has become our most rapid and effective platform for global conflict. We revel in it.

We are angry. Cause, after cause, we claw at each other and spit vitriol. The destination is equilibrium. It is equanimity for everything. All of our stories, every possible human narrative, each and every one will have their champions. Everyone, everything, every modality, every state - as long as it does not harm others - will be accepted. 

Axiomatic social rhythms have undergone gleeful decimation. We do not need old philosophers to educate us upon the relativity of truth, to remind us that the world is many shades, that there are always more questions. We can now sit back, flick through a glowing screen, and witness it all. The red, the blue, the black, the white, all culminating in an endless flow of mud. Our thoughts are no longer valuable. 

Our social reality is in tatters. The next wall to topple will be that of our limitations. We are participants in the exhaustion of intellect. We are nearing mastery of our tangible reality. There is work to do. But it is within our grasp. We can meet the needs of every person on the planet. The sun gives us power. Our ingenuity has produced efficiencies and artworks that defy the imagination. We can return to natural balance with the nature, with Earth. Our species is destined to dance within the cosmos. The game is almost over.  Our labour is no longer valuable. 

But then what’s next? What is left? What are we?

Ancient and brilliant spiritual philosophies and modern psychologies share a common thread. There is the construct, our thoughts, the mind, the ego, the self; the thing with many names. Beyond the thing is the watcher, the observer, our spirit, the truth; God. 

We are not our thoughts. We are not our output. We are what is behind them. We are what watches it all unfold. And in that entity, we are the collective. The maps of the mind were written during millennia of introspection. When one focuses inward, the illusion breaks. You are not what you _think_ you are. You are not what other people _think_ you are. You are the Truth. You are behind all of these narratives.

Identifying your ego, your self-construct, was a challenge, once. It took a therapist to help you point out your patterns, to peer into your subconscious. Or, it took years of diligent meditation and self-observation. But to see it now, to learn its tricks, to see the folly of its desires and passions, we need only look at the profiles we have crafted for ourselves. 

Our egos sit in the magical slab resting in the palm of our hand. What is it that stares through the glowing pane of glass? Who is it that crafted this facsimile of self? This caricature is not you. You are what brought it into being. That is what _we_ are.

Just as gravity did not appear when Newton wrote the formula, we will not construct the singularity. We will see its truth from within the Ether, then give it name. But it was always there. We did not need the invisible fabric of the Internet to weave us all together. We were already woven. It is time for our ascension.
