People seem uncomfortable having opinions. I’ve heard people claim with pride that they have weak opinions that they hold weakly. Even more troubling are those who state with superiority that they have no opinions whatsoever. Strong opinions are good and there is nothing wrong with having them.

> “All opinions are not equal. Some are a very great deal more robust, sophisticated and well supported in logic and argument than others.” ― Douglas Adams

Merriann-Webster gives us three definitions of opinion:

* a : a view, judgment, or appraisal formed in the mind about a particular matter

* b : belief stronger than impression and less strong than positive knowledge

* c : a formal expression of judgment or advice by an expert

An opinion is not a fact. A fact is verifiable. The cup weights 1lb. You can put the cup upon a scale and prove that it does, in fact, weight 1lb. An opinion is akin to a belief. An opinion is a working theory. 

Definition c sticks out. If an opinion is ‘a formal expression of judgment or advice by an expert’, why do we frown upon them in an engineering environment? What's wrong with a working theory? We've decided that we want data, fact, proof. We've decided there is a right answer and a wrong answer.

If the expression of an expert’s knowledge and experience is their opinion, it should be valuable. But it isn’t. We’re skeptical because opinions are the precursor to ignorance. They're hard to contend with. You just want to _do_ something, but someone else has their mind made up already. They don't know what you know -- you're right, they're wrong! They aren't looking at the data.

> “When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions, even if this new information is obviously more accurate.” ― Nassim Nicholas Taleb

Consider that you’ve invested 15 hours into building a new service. A contrary new idea appears and says that something different is better. You might have an opinion or two about that.

Rightfully so! Engineering is complicated. There isn’t a playbook to follow. Everything being built is being built to the spec of someone’s best guess. You made yours, you know what you’re doing, you’ve worked hard, and you feel compelled to defend your decisions.

This contrary new idea is backed by the illustrious data. I’ve spent time working within IBM. I understand what it’s like when an empowered new word appears to instil the fear, uncertainty, and doubt intended to shake your axiomatic foundations. The data will over-come and conquer; all those before data are obsolete.  

Even though the industry changes at an unfathomable pace, data has the beast finally mastered. The new ideal to replace the free-spirited _Opinion Driven Development_ is _Data Driven Development_. 

We want data driven decisions, now. You shouldn’t build that, because the data says… We should optimize for this instead, because the data says… But there’s a funny thing about data. Data is not always factual. You still need to interpret it.

> “Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are incapable of forming such opinions." ― Albert Einstein

Ted Kaptchuk, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School wrote a fascinating article titled the [Effect of interpretive bias on research evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1126323/#ref16). His conclusions are important and should be well understood by any organization trying to put data high upon an organizational pedestal:

**a: evidence does not speak for itself and must be interpreted for quality and likelihood of error.**

Logging and data ingress points are integral parts of your stack. But in a curious twist, it’s unlikely that ‘data’ was used to build your logging infrastructure.  In all likelihood, it wasn’t developed in-house, either. 

Are you sure that your collection of data is even accurate and clean? How sure are you that the data isn’t being misrepresented or full of error? How are you organizing your data to optimize for valuable and ‘objective’ interpretation? 

**b: interpretation is never completely independent of a scientist's beliefs, preconceptions, or theoretical commitments.**

The articulate will bend data to fit their narrative. This is as natural a human tendency as breathing. The observer will always be present within their observations.

**c: on the cutting edge of science, scientific interpretation can lead to sound judgment or interpretative biases; the distinction can often be made only in retrospect.**

This feels obvious, given the context. But it’s important. The decision you make at a point in time is only proven a “good” or “sound” decision over time. Inception through data does not provide immediate verification of the conclusion.

> “The opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists; indeed the passion is the measure of the holders lack of rational conviction. Opinions in politics and religion are almost always held passionately.” ― Bertrand Russell

If we can’t trust opinions and we can’t trust data, what can we trust? I believe that we _can_ trust both of them. But we need to understand the folly of clinging to _any_ belief or interpretation. This is part of team-work. It’s part of creating a culture around what happens when something goes from ideation to creation.  

You’re likely well paid. You’re probably an expert, too. You should have strong opinions. When forming your opinions, summon your experience, intuition, education, and your _data_. Use all of the tools available to you. Open your mind. 

Materialize it as best you can. Write it out. Write it well, make it structured.  When you collate your assumptions, do they hold up to your own scrutiny? If they do, become their champion. Put your opinion forward.

When a new idea arrives to challenge it, the new idea needs to do the work. The onus is on _it_ now to demonstrate that it is more sound than your own. Don’t give up before the battle because of who is holding it or because it's based on a metric that seems compelling. Dig into it. Explore it. Question it. Be sceptical. Be sure. But give it a chance. If it succeeds, concede.

To do this with grace, you’ll need to pull your self-worth out of your ideas. Be cool about it. You are not your ideas. If you’re wrong, or right, or half-wrong, or some-what right, it doesn’t matter.

Do not let others bully you into insecurity by telling you you’re opinionated or stubborn. Do not pay heed to those acting self-righteous because they’re too cowardly to hold opinions. Do not let others abuse your aversion to friction to manipulate how you think or feel.

Your opinion will do nothing but reflect positively upon you if you trust your heart, think lucidly, and put forward well-distilled, logical, and rational arguments. Be strong. Have strong opinions.
